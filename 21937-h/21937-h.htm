INTRODUCTION</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstletter">B</span>OTH volumes of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Scandinavian Classics</span> selected to appear in 1916 are
by natives of Iceland. They belong, however, to periods of time and to
modes of writing remote from each other. Snorri Sturluson, the greatest
of Icelandic historians, was born in 1179. His <i>Prose Edda</i>, the
companion-piece of the present volume, is a Christian's account of Old
Norse myths and poetic conceptions thus happily preserved as they were
about to pass into oblivion. More than seven hundred years separate
Jóhann Sigurjónsson from Snorri, and his work is in dramatic, not saga
form. But even as in outward appearance modern Iceland is not unlike
ancient Iceland, so the Icelandic writers of the present have marked
kinship with the past. Despite many centuries of relative neglect, the
old traditions lived on, cherished by scholars, until now, at the
beginning of the twentieth century, the Icelandic mind appears to be
again renascent and creative. Einar Jónsson, the sculptor, has his
counterpart in the domain of letters in such recent writers as Jónas
Jónasson, Emar Hjörleifsson, Gudmundur Magnússon, Jónas Gudlaugsson,
Gunnar Gunnarson, and Gudmundur Kamban, while every important fjord and
valley can claim its own poet or novelist. As yet, the most
distinguished performance of these younger authors is the play printed
in this volume, <i>Eyvind of the Hills</i> (<i>Bjærg-Ejvind og hans
Hustru</i>), by Jóhann Sigurjónsson. Among literary phenomena <i>Eyvind
of the Hills</i> is a surprise, almost as though Iceland woke to find
her naked mountains clothed in forest in a night.</p>

<p>Let Sigurjónsson tell his life story in his own words:<a class =
"tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a>
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
"I&nbsp;was born June 19, 1880, on a large farm in the northern part of
Iceland. Our household numbered about twenty people. A&nbsp;broad
stream, well stocked with salmon; on both sides of the river, rocks
where thousands of eider-ducks had their nests; a&nbsp;view out over the
Atlantic with high cliffs where sea-birds lived; lava-fields with
unusual flowers; and in the distance blue mountains; such was the
theatre where I acted my childhood pieces and where I wrote my first
poems.</p>

<p>"When fourteen years old, I was sent to school at Reykjavik; but
after pocketing the diploma of the upper class, my longing led me down
to Copenhagen, where I chose the study of veterinary science. For three
years I worked zealously at my studies and took all the preliminary
examinations required, until suddenly I burned my ships and resolutely
threw myself into the work of a playwright. At first one difficulty
piled up after another. To begin with, I&nbsp;had to write in a language
not my own. And then, what knowledge I had of human nature was limited
to a most incomplete knowledge of myself and of a few college chums of
my own age. Besides, it was not long before I had to concern myself
about mere bread and butter.</p>

<p>"My first victory was an appreciative letter from Björnstjerne
Björnson, wherein he promised warmly to recommend me to Gyldendal's, the
great publishing house, which subsequently published my first play,
<i>Dr. Rung</i>.</p>

<p>"My second victory was the acceptance by the Dagmar Theatre of <i>The
Hraun Farm</i>. After the sometime directors of that theatre resigned,
my play passed into the control of the Royal Theatre. Finally,
I&nbsp;made my stage debut with <i>Eyvind of the Hills</i>, which was
received with much enthusiasm both by press and public.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
"In order to give as much actuality as possible to this drama,
I&nbsp;traversed Iceland on foot from north to south and saw the places
high up in the wild mountain waste where Eyvind lived with his wife. In
my little garret in Copenhagen I had learned by my own experience the
agony of loneliness."</p>

<p>Sigurjónsson's first drama, <i>Dr. Rung</i>, was written in Danish
and published in 1905. This tragedy presents a young Copenhagen
physician, Harold Rung, who is endeavoring to find a specific against
tuberculosis. In order to test the effect of his serum, he decides to
inoculate himself with the disease, and the pleading of Vilda, who loves
him, fails to shake him from his purpose. The remedy proves a failure;
the young scientist goes mad, giving Vilda poisoned grapes.</p>

<p><i>The Hraun Farm</i> was published in Icelandic in 1908 (<i>Bóndinn
á Hrauni</i>), and in Danish in 1912 (<i>Gaarden Hraun</i>). In
rewriting the play for the Copenhagen stage, Sigurjónsson gave it a
happy ending, thus changing a tragedy into a pleasant dramatic idyl of
contemporary country life in Iceland. It is the familiar Scandinavian
theme of the struggle of human love with love of the homestead. An old
farmer, Sveinungi, is a veritable patriarch living at the edge of the
"hraun," the lava-field. His only daughter, Ljot, he has destined for a
sturdy neighbor's son, who will keep up the estate. But the girl falls
in love with a young geologist and arouses her father's wrath, until the
play ends with a scene in which Sveinungi is won over by Jorunn, his
persuasive wife. The action is interrupted by an earthquake. The
dialogue is well maintained and rises to heights of lyrical splendor. In
point of dramatic effectiveness, <i>The Hraun Farm</i> may be regarded
as only a preliminary study compared
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
to the next play, but its picture of pastoral Iceland makes it a fitting
companion-piece to the greater drama in the present volume.</p>

<p>All other work of Sigurjónsson and the younger Icelandic dramatists
pales beside <i>Eyvind of the Hills</i>, written in Danish and published
in 1911.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a>
The high sky of dramatic vision, the simple nobility of the characters
portrayed, and the poetry of exalted passion raise above the ordinary
this stern tragedy of natural lives in the wilderness. Eyvind is a man
of heroic mould, who was forced by circumstances and hunger to the state
of a common thief. When outlawed, he fled to the mountains. Seeking
human companionship, he now descends into a valley where his identity is
unknown and takes service with Halla, a&nbsp;rich young widow. She
learns of his disguise only to fall in love with his real character.
Persecuted by her brother-in-law, who wishes to marry her, and possessed
by a great love, she insists on sharing the outlaw's lot and escapes
with him to his old haunt in the mountains. Here they have two children,
but she is obliged to sacrifice them both in turn, and to flee ever
farther away. The last act finds the outlaw and his wife facing each
other in a lonely hut, in the midst of a snowstorm which has shut off
every avenue of sustenance. Although the beautiful reality of love is
there, they are tormented by hunger and utter need into doubts and
mutual reproaches, and at last seek death in the snow.</p>

<p>According to the historical facts upon which the story is based, a
stray horse found its way to the hut of the starving couple, and so
their lives were saved. Sigurjónsson used
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
this ending when he rewrote the last scenes of the fourth act for Fru
Dybvad, who played the part of Halla in Copenhagen, concluding with
Halla's exclamation: "So there is then a God!" With <i>Eyvind</i>, as
with <i>The Hraun Farm</i>, we can thus take our choice of two
endings.</p>

<p><i>The Wish</i> (<i>Önsket</i>), Sigurjónsson's latest play, was
published in 1915. Gloomy and terrible, but strong and restrained, it is
built on a theme of seduction, remorse, and forgiveness in death, woven
about the legendary figure of Galdra-Loftur, who lived in Iceland at the
beginning of the eighteenth century. It ends with an intensely dramatic
scene in the old cathedral church at Hólar.</p>

<p>In addition to these four plays, Sigurjónsson has also written some
beautiful verse.</p>

<p>In Mrs. Schanche, Sigurjónsson has a translator well fitted by
artistic family traditions for the task. Herself of Norwegian descent,
she has been for upward of thirty years a resident of Philadelphia. She
has interpreted the pure idiom of Sigurjónsson's dialogue with real
dramatic perception. In editing the volume the Publication Committee has
had the valuable assistance of Hanna Astrup Larsen.</p>

<p>Georg Brandes, the veteran Danish critic, though not given to over
optimism, has recognized Sigurjónsson's distinction, and the Icelander
is acclaimed by the public who best know Ibsen and Strindberg, in
Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Christiania. <i>Eyvind</i> has been
successful also on the German stage. "Poetic talent of high order," says
Brandes, "manifests itself in this new drama, with its seriousness,
rugged force, and strong feeling. Few leading characters, but these with
a most intense inner life; courage to confront the actual, and
exceptional skill to depict it; material fully mastered and a
corresponding confident
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
style!" And the French critic, Leon Pineau, concludes a long account of
Sigurjónsson's production with the following estimate of <i>Eyvind of
the Hills</i>: "In this drama there is no haze of fantasy, no bold and
startling thesis, not even a new theory of art&mdash;nothing but poetry;
not the poetry of charming and fallacious words, not that of lulling
rhythm, nor of dazzling imagery which causes forgetfulness, but the
sublimely powerful poetry which creates being of flesh and blood like
ourselves&mdash;to whom Jóhann Sigurjónsson has given of his own
soul."</p>

<p>Written by the author in a language not his by birth, this
rock-ribbed tragedy of the strong and simple passions of Iceland lends
itself peculiarly to international interpretation. It is with some
curiosity, therefore, as well as satisfaction, that we introduce to
English readers a young representative of the renaissance of Icelandic
literature. How will he be judged by our countrymen, and what will be
his place, if any, upon the American stage?</p>

A "badstofa" or servants' hall. Along each side-wall, a row of bedsteads
with bright coverlets of knitted wool. Between the bedsteads,
a&nbsp;narrow passageway. On the right, the entrance, which is reached
by a staircase. On the left, opposite the entrance, a&nbsp;dormer-window
with panes of bladder. On the right, over the bedsteads, a&nbsp;similar
window. Long green blades of grass are visible through the panes. In the
centre back a door opens into Halla's bed-chamber, which is separated
from the "badstofa" by a thin board partition. A&nbsp;small table-leaf
is attached by hinges to the partition. A&nbsp;copper train-oil lamp is
fastened in the doorcase. Over the nearest bedsteads a cross-beam runs
at a man's height from the floor; from this to the roof-tree is half of
a man's height. Under the window stands a painted chest. Carved wooden
boxes are pushed in under the bedsteads. The "badstofa" is old, the
woodwork blackened by age and soot.</p>

It is early spring, a late afternoon. Gudfinna and Oddny are sitting on
the beds facing each other, Gudfinna mending shoes, Oddny putting
patches on a coat. The Shepherd Boy is standing in the middle of the
room, throwing a dart adorned with red cock's feathers. The costumes are
old Icelandic.</p>

If they had, you wouldn't be riding such a high horse now!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Gudfinna.</span>
Have they been bad to you, laddie? Do you never feel timid when you are
alone so much?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">The Boy.</span>
Sometimes I keep thinking what I should do if a mad bull came tearing
down the mountains.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Gudfinna.</span>
Don't speak of them! They are the worst monsters in the
world&mdash;except, perhaps, the skoffin.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">The Boy.</span>
What is a skoffin?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Gudfinna.</span>
Don't you know that? When a rooster gets to be very old, he lays an egg,
and if that's hatched, it becomes a skoffin. It kills a man by just
looking at him, and the only thing that can slay it is a church-blessed
silver bullet. Indeed, there are many things you have to be careful of,
my child. Are you not afraid of the outlaws? They're not good, those
fellows; they go about in skins with the wool on them and carry long
sticks with ice-spurs, and that at midsummer. Have you ever seen
anything of them?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">The Boy.</span>
No, but yesterday I pretty near got scared. There came a man with a big
bag under his arm. I&nbsp;didn't know him at first, but it was only
Arnes.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Gudfinna.</span>
And what did he want of you?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">The Boy.</span>
He asked me to show him the way to a spring. He was thirsty.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Gudfinna.</span>
You had better not have too much talk with him.
<span class = "desc">(Hands him the shoes.)</span>

I am going now to drive them home. I was waiting for my shoes.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Have you seen anything of the cows to-day?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">The Boy.</span>
No.
<span class = "desc">(To Oddny.)</span>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (smiling).</span>
I heard him teasing you a while ago.</p>

He's forever pestering me about Kari&mdash;as if I cared!</p>

Kari's.

<p><span class = "speaker">Oddny (is silent for a moment and looks at

What are you talking about?
<span class = "desc">(Pushes the box under the bed.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oddny.</span>
Do you know who was Halla's father?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Gudfinna.</span>
That is what no one seems to know. Some would have it that he was a
parson.
<span class = "desc">(She darns the stockings.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oddny.</span>
Yes, or a vagabond. There were also some ugly whispers about a stain on
her birth.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Gudfinna.</span>
You'd better bridle your tongue!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oddny.</span>
I am not so dull as you imagine. When Halla thinks no one is looking,
she doesn't take her eyes from Kari. And she has made him overseer; that
seems queer to others besides me. Last Sunday at church some one asked
me if there was anything between the widow and the "overseer."</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Gudfinna.</span>
And what did you say?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oddny.</span>
I told them that it was quite possible Halla had her lines out for him,
but that I did not think Kari would swallow the fly, even if it had gold
on its wings.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Gudfinna.</span>
Much good it did you, the gospel you heard in church! I&nbsp;am sorry
for you, poor girl! You are crazy about a man who has neither eye nor
ear for you, but that is no reason why you should be running around
spreading gossip. Halla is not the kind of woman that is fond of men.
There was never a harsh word between her and her
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
husband, God rest his soul, but there was not much love-making between
them either. No, indeed!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oddny.</span>
Well, what of that! He was a man up in years and had a fine farm.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Gudfinna.</span>
He was an upright and honest man, and Halla made him a good wife, my
dear.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oddny.</span>
Who doubts that?
<span class = "desc">(Silence.)</span>
I&nbsp;don't know what ails Kari of late. Yesterday he flew into a rage
when I asked him if he knew of a cure for freckles. I&nbsp;hope Halla
has not become such a saint yet that one can't notice her freckles.</p>

I&nbsp;should like to have known you in your young days. I&nbsp;dare say
you knew how to handle a rake.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Gudfinna (straightening her back).</span>
You may be sure. On dry ground, two lively fellows had all they could do
to make ready for my rake.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
And you were not afraid to tuck up your skirts, where the ground was low

Well, it may be true that I am pretty strong, but I should like to see

<p><span class = "speaker">Oddny.</span>
I know one whom Kari couldn't stand against.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Magnus.</span>
And who is that?
<span class = "desc">(Sigrid pulls at his stockings.)</span>
There! There!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oddny.</span>
Bjørn, Halla's brother-in-law.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Magnus.</span>
I should not be afraid to bet on Kari against him.

Give me the stockings!

I don't think Kari would dare to try a fall with the bailiff.</p>

If you were the prize, I should not dare to!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
It does not look as if the cows were coming

Arnes puts his head in at the door; he carries a large bag.</p>

Good evening! I did not want to trouble any one to come to the outside

Now Arnes is rich&mdash;there's gold sand in my bag.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I dare say there is.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
You people don't know what lies hidden in the hills. I&nbsp;have heard
of a man who lost his way in Surt's Cave. For days he walked
underground, and when at last he came up he had gold sand in his
shoes.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
What would you do if that were really gold in your bag?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
Then Arnes would do many things. You should help yourself to all your
hands could hold, and as many times as you have given me shelter, and
Arngrim the leper should also fill his fists. I&nbsp;know of no one else
to whom I care to do good.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Gudfinna.</span>
And should I have nothing?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
I would give you new, long ear-locks of gold.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Magnus (laughing).</span>
Some little gift you'd surely have for the bailiff&mdash;no?</p>

For him? Yes, if I could throw the sand into his eyes.
<span class = "desc">(Opens the bag and takes out a handful of Iceland

They are fine, these lichens, and taste good when you cook them in

As you may know, I&nbsp;haven't a very good name. I&nbsp;can't settle

Not that I know of.</p>

Is it about me and Halla?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
I have heard that too, but this story is about yourself.</p>

I would rather be spared listening to gossip.</p>

You are at least frank.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes (rising).</span>
It is all the same to me, but if you have anything to hide, you had

There was a big black patch on the left knee.</p>

That rake would be too heavy for me.</p>

So many things come back to me to-night that I have not thought of

I know nothing wrong of Arnes, and I do know that he is grateful for
what I can offer him.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
I thought you had heard the common talk. His record is not of the best,
I&nbsp;am sorry to say. I&nbsp;have been told that little things are apt
to be missing where he has made his stay.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I would rather bear such a loss in silence than perhaps throw suspicion
on an innocent man.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
Finely thought! Yet some one must be the first to warn the unwary.
<span class = "desc">(Takes snuff.)</span>
You must hear what happened to me not long ago. The boy lost two milch
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
sheep up in the hills. I&nbsp;was vexed that it should occur so early in
the summer when they still had their wool, and therefore I sent one of
my men to look for them. Near Red Peak he found tracks of the sheep and
also the footprints of a large man.
<span class = "desc">(Lowering his voice.)</span>
You could do me a good turn if you would give Arnes a pair of new shoes;
I&nbsp;should pay for them, of course. He will not suspect anything, if
you do it. Then you keep his old shoes for me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (rising).</span>
No, I will have nothing to do with that.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
Then we shan't speak of it any more. I think I shall find out what I am
after, nevertheless.
<span class = "desc">(He is silent.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You surely didn't come here to-night for Arnes's sake?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
I did not. Was Kari at church last Sunday?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Why do you ask?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
I know that he was there.
<span class = "desc">(Sits down.)</span>
You are satisfied with him as an overseer?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (sits down).</span>
In every way.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
All the same, I advise you to get rid of him, the sooner the better.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (laughing).</span>
I thank you for your kind advice.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
My advice is not to be scorned, and besides, am I not your
brother-in-law?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
My sheep had to learn that to their cost, when they strayed in on your
pastures, and you set your dogs on them.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
Even though we have not always been as neighborly as I might wish, you
must listen to me this time. I&nbsp;have always disliked Kari;
I&nbsp;would never have hired that man. Believe me, there is something
underhanded about him. Nobody knows him, and no one has heard of his
people. It is as if he had shot up out of the ground. The
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
only thing you know about him is that his name is Kari, and you don't
even know that.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (rising).</span>
What are you driving at with all this?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
Sit still.
<span class = "desc">(Halla sits down.)</span>
Last fall two strangers who stopped on their journey through here
thought they knew Kari. They said it was easier to change one's name
than one's face. As bad luck would have it, I&nbsp;did not get a chance
to talk with them myself, but my suspicions were roused. Now there is a
man staying with me who has just come from the south. He saw Kari at
church last Sunday, and if he is right, it is an ugly story.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn (rising).</span>
Neither more nor less than that your overseer's name is not Kari but
Eyvind, that he was locked up for theft, and got away.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (has risen).</span>
You must be mad, both of you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
The man would not swear that he had seen right.
<span class = "desc">(Smiles.)</span>
Somehow he seemed sorry that he had told me. He said he had never seen
two people more alike, and Eyvind had a scar on his forehead just as
Kari has&mdash;that much he remembered plainly.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
It was last Sunday at church that he saw Kari?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
Yes.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (laughing).</span>
Kari was not at church last Sunday.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
That's queer. Two of my men were there. But we can easily solve that
riddle, if I bring my guest over here to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I don't believe for a moment that Kari is a thief.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
You need not believe it. Simply tell him what I have said, and that I
mean to have the judge look into the matter. I&nbsp;warrant he will be
out of the house before sunrise.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You are quick to believe evil and quick to run to the judge, but in this
case you will not reap much honor.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
If you suppose I shall act hastily, you are mistaken. I&nbsp;shall write
to the county that Eyvind hails from and give the letter to my guest,
who will see that it gets safely and speedily into the proper hands. The
answer can be here within two or three months.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Is it out of kindness to me that you are so eager about this matter?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
If it is true what people say, it would be best for you that Kari should
take himself away from here as fast as can be. You might find it harder
to part from him two or three months hence.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (icily).</span>
Now you show your real self. You did not come here to give me kind
counsel, nor do I look for such from you, but you had better leave me
and my household in peace. Do you think I have forgotten what you did to
me? When your brother told you that he intended to marry me, you thought
it would be a disgrace to the family for him to make a poor servant girl
his wife. You urged him to satisfy his fleeting passion, as you called
it, without any marriage.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
I never said that.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (laying her hand on her heart).</span>
In here I have a sealed book in which I keep the words my friends have
spoken. And I have more to tell you. There was something behind
it&mdash;your fear of losing a part of your power.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
What are you saying?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Did that prick your soul, you godly man! You knew that your brother
would follow your advice like a child, but you had misgivings that you
could not work me
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
like dough in your hands, and what you feared came true. You can never
forget that I made my husband stand on his own feet. I&nbsp;know your
greed for power! But now I warn you for all time to let me and mine
alone.
<span class = "desc">(Sits down.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn (flushed with anger, but still
controlling his voice).</span>
Much have I learned to-night that I did not know before. Now I see why
you made Kari overseer. You are not your mother's daughter for
nothing.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (her lips trembling).</span>
You want to make me angry. You can't do it. Nor shall you succeed in
blackening Kari in my eyes. You were hoping that I should hurt him by
telling him what you have said. I&nbsp;shall not tell him.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
You will talk differently when I hold the proof in my hand.
<span class = "desc">(Shakes his hand; goes toward the door.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (rising, hatred burning in her
eyes).</span>
Just before you came, the servants were making bets about who was best
at <i>glima</i>, you or Kari. Oddny was the only one who stood up for
you. Kari thought you had grown so old and stiff in your joints that you
would not dare to go in for a wrestling-match.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
Tell Kari that I am ready to meet him this evening, if he wishes it.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
No, I shall tell Kari that you have given your word to wrestle with him
at the big sheep-folds in the fall. I&nbsp;hope to have a good many
witnesses, when the bailiff bites the dust.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
I will fight him whenever and wherever he may wish&mdash;anywhere but in
jail. Good-bye!

You wanted to speak to me?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I hear you have made a fine catch. Thank you! I&nbsp;have promised the
bailiff that you shall meet him in
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
a <i>glima</i> at the folds in the autumn. What do you say to that?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I call that great news, but surely that was not what he came here for
to-night?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
No, he had another errand. He spoke ill of you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
What did he say?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
There is a man just come from the south who saw you at church last
Sunday. He told Bjørn that you looked like some one by the name of
Eyvind, a&nbsp;thief who had run away. He even thought he recognized the
scar on your forehead.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (in a low voice, sitting down).</span>
And did the bailiff believe the man was right?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
He said I should tell you that he meant to speak to the judge, and that
then you would flee from here this very night.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (rising with a loud laugh).</span>
This is to laugh at. Do you know when they will come to catch the <ins

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (has been looking at him steadily;
holds out her hand to him).</span>
Give me your hand, Kari, and say that you have nothing to fear from any
man.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (evasively).</span>
I understand that this seems strange to you, but the man who saw me must
be some one who has a grudge against me from former days, and does this
out of spite.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
What do I care about him or about the bailiff! Say that you are
innocent!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>

My eyes did not lie to-night.
<span class = "desc">(Stands for a moment in terrible emotion; then

I&nbsp;knew a man named Eyvind. His father was poor and had many
children. Eyvind was the next to the oldest. It was said in those parts
that thieving ran in the blood of his kin, though no one could say
anything against Eyvind's father.
<span class = "desc">(Halla looks up, listening.)</span>
Two years ago or more, toward the end of the winter, it happened, as
often before, that there was no food in the house. Eyvind went to the
parson to ask him to help them out with food. He offered to pay for it
with his work in the spring, but the parson refused. It was late in the
evening, dark and snowing. The road to Eyvind's home went past the
parson's sheep-cots.
<span class = "desc">(As Kari proceeds, he now and then passes his hand
over his forehead.)</span>
They loomed before him like a big black mound. Then the temptation
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
came over him. The herdsman had gone home, the snow would cover up the
tracks, and the parson was rich enough. I&nbsp;hated him!
<span class = "desc">(Halla rises.)</span>
Late that night, Eyvind came home with a fine big sheep. The next day,
word came from the parson. They had found his mittens in the sheep-cot.
Eyvind was locked up and given ten years in prison. They thought they
could prove that he had more thefts to answer for&mdash;
<span class = "desc">(He breaks off suddenly.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (breathlessly).</span>
Kari!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>

I&nbsp;fled and lived one year in the hills as an outlaw.</p>

After this I shall never believe in any one.
<span class = "desc">(Sits down and bursts into tears.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (kneeling).</span>
Do with me what you will. Drive me out of your
house&mdash;now&mdash;this evening, or give me into the hands of the
law, but you must forgive me. It was our poverty and the snow that made
me steal.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (rising).</span>
I will not cry. It is stupid to cry. Get up! I&nbsp;am no God that you
should ask my forgiveness.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (rising to his feet).</span>
It is lonesome to live a whole winter up there in the hills. That is why
I ventured down here, far from home, and under a new name. Since then I
have gone about like one who walks in his sleep, afraid of the
awakening. Many a time have I made up my mind to tell you the whole
truth, but somehow it seemed to get harder with every day that passed.
I&nbsp;have never understood why it was so before to-night, but now I
know it, and now I can speak of it. Kari has loved you. You are the only
woman he has ever loved, but now Kari is no more, and never has been
anything but the dream of a poor and unhappy man.</p>

No, this is the first time. I promised them last spring that if they
were good and worked hard I would bring them, and they have surely
earned it. It's past belief how much they can do, no older than they
are.</p>

I should not wonder if the winter were to come early after so good a
summer.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Second Peasant.</span>
God knows how many sheep the hills have taken this year! Do you remember
those cold days in the spring? It may be a good many lambs froze to
death.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">First Peasant.</span>
And then those cursed foxes!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jon.</span>
The foxes are nothing to the men&mdash;both those down here and those in
the hills.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Second Peasant.</span>
I don't believe there is anybody living in the hills, at least not in
these parts.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jon.</span>
You don't believe it? I tell you, my good man, there are more outlaws
than you think. To my mind, the laws are to blame for it. If I had my
say, all thieves would be strung up.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Second Peasant.</span>
Well, I look at it in another way. I believe the laws are too strict. It
seems to me it is making too much of the sheep, when a man is locked up
for life because he has stolen two or three of them.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jon.</span>
You always have to be of a different mind from anybody else.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<p class = "desc">
(Halla comes back and listens.)</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Second Peasant.</span>
I don't know about that, but those who flee to the hills do it from
need. If the laws were milder, I&nbsp;believe there would be no outlaws.
What do you say, Arngrim?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arngrim.</span>
If we were all to be judged by our thoughts, the hills would be swarming
with outlaws.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
It is too light yet to be talking about thieves. Can't you tell us
something funny?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jon's Wife.</span>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
Good day to you all! So you want a story?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jon.</span>
You shall have a drink if you tell us a story, but it must be a good
one.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
Hand me the bottle.
<span class = "desc">(Drinks.)</span>
I could tell you some spook stories that would make your hair stand on
end, but they are better told in the gloaming.
<span class = "desc">(Laughs.)</span>
The girls are less afraid of us men folks when they hear about
spooks.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jon (laughing).</span>
Yes, of two evils men are better than spooks.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes (sees Halla).</span>
Now I know what I shall tell you. Hush! Once upon a time there were two
outlaws. What their crime had been I don't know, but they had to flee to
the hills to save their lives. They found a green spot among the
glaciers, hemmed in by huge rocks. There they built their hut, for there
they knew they would be left in
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
peace. But the hills were hankering for their old loneliness and hated
those two, and swore they would drive them away. First they sent the
storms and the frost. There came a winter night so terrible that the
roots of the grass trembled with fear under the snow, but unknown to
those two their love had built an invisible wall around the hut, and the
storm and the snow could not get in. Then the hills sent hunger. It came
to them in their dreams, tempting them with sweet-smelling hot bread and
butter fresh from the churn. It would have them barter their
love&mdash;</p>

Enter a Farm Hand.</p>

Where do you get your courage? I&nbsp;can't understand that you have not

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I will tell you where I get my courage.
<span class = "desc">(Kisses her.)</span>
I&nbsp;don't know how the days can be so gloriously long. It seems to me

You love me!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (is silent for a moment).</span>
I love you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You don't know how much that one word promises me. It means the sunshine
on the hills. It means the streams and lakes. Shall I tell you
something, Kari? Something you don't know?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
What could that be?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I am not going to say it just now, but I will tell you something else.
I&nbsp;care a thousand times more for you now than I did three months
ago. <!-- What happened to summer? --> Do you know why?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
No.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Because you are so brave. You sleep in my arms as calmly as if you had
not a foe in the whole country.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (smiling).</span>
I must have borrowed your courage.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
It is dear to see you smile. Your hair is like a cloud, and when you
smile it seems to lift from your forehead.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
You must not make me out braver than I am. Part of my courage is
recklessness. I&nbsp;close my eyes and let the sun shine on my face.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Do you never think of the future?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (earnestly).</span>
I do.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I have blamed myself much these last days. I&nbsp;ought to have sent you
away long ago, but I could not. I&nbsp;had to be sure that you loved me.
Last night I heard the hills calling you, and I called against them with
all my soul. If you had never come back, I&nbsp;would have forgiven you,
though it had broken my heart.
<span class = "desc">(Exultantly.)</span>
And then I saw you coming down the mountain like a god, driving a white
snowslide before you!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Did you think I could have gone without letting you know?
I&nbsp;remember once you had fallen asleep in my arms. The night was
light. Your eyes were closed, but I could see through your eyelids.
I&nbsp;saw a little girl with black hair.
<span class = "desc">(Fondly stroking her hair.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (taking his right hand).</span>
How well I know this hand!
<span class = "desc">(Lays it on her heart.)</span>
My heart beats with joy.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I am like the man in the fairy-tale who fell down into a deep well. He
thought he would never again see the sun, but suddenly he stood in a
green meadow. There was a tall castle, and the king's daughter came out
to meet him. Halla, do you understand? If I had not stolen, we two
should never have met.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
That is true.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
The year I lived in the hills, I would sometimes get into such a rage
that I wanted to give myself a good
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
thrashing. Once I really did it&mdash;I&nbsp;beat myself with a knotted
rope.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
How you must have suffered!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
If anybody had told me in those days that I should ever become a happy
man, I&nbsp;would have laughed at him. Then I believed riches and honors
meant happiness. I&nbsp;used to dream of riding through the parish where
I was born, dressed in fine clothes and with many horses.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (laughing).</span>
I did not know you were vain.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Nor am I any more, but I have grown stingy. The minutes are my
gold-pieces.
<span class = "desc">(Takes her hand.)</span>
When I hold your hand in mine, I&nbsp;am happy. Before I cared for you,
I&nbsp;did not see the sun shining, and now when it rains, all the drops
prattle about you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You do love me!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I seem to be in a church. I hold a torch in my hand and light one taper
after another. For every taper that is lighted, the church grows larger
and more beautiful. But I am a thief. If I am caught I must be buried
alive, and now the church-bells are ringing. I&nbsp;hear the crowd
gathering outside.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You frighten me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (taking her face between his
hands).</span>
I&nbsp;must have a long look at your face. If I were to become blind
this moment, I&nbsp;should always remember it. Your soul is in your
eyes. When you look at me, I&nbsp;feel an unseen hand fondling my face.
Whenever the sun shines, I&nbsp;shall see your eyes. It is hard to tell
you, but when the sky grows red to-morrow, I&nbsp;shall be on my way to
the hills. I&nbsp;must flee this very night.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I knew it.
<span class = "desc">(Sits down.)</span>
Tell me how you have planned your flight.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I must be off before the winter sets in, and besides the letter from the
south may be here any day now.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I know all that.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (sits down).</span>
When I come home to-night, I&nbsp;shall say that I have seen the tracks
of a flock of sheep farther up in the hills than we usually go to look
for them. I&nbsp;shall ask you for two horses. You won't refuse me them?
<span class = "desc">(Halla shakes her head.)</span>
I&nbsp;shall say that I must start at once, this very night, before the
tracks disappear. When I don't come back, they will think I have come
across outlaws or have met with an accident.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
And where shall you go?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
To the mountain plain where the warm springs are. I&nbsp;lived there
before I came to you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
How long will it take you to reach it?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Three days. It is about in the middle of the country.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
And there you will build your hut?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
No; last time I lived in a lava cave. I had brought with me some tools
that my brother gave me, and I left them there. Something told me that I
might need them again.
<span class = "desc">(He is silent.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (taking his hand).</span>
You must tell me more, much more. I&nbsp;want to see the place where you
will live
<span class = "desc">(with a strange smile)</span>, so that I can come
and visit you in my thoughts.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I forget what I have told you and what I have not told you. You may
think that the hills are wild and forbidding, but that is not so at all.
In the summer, when the sun is shining, they are beautiful. The glaciers
lie like white untrodden land in a sea of sand, their lower rim flashing
green and blue in the sunlight. When you come nearer, you see a chain of
jagged sandhills like a dark surf, where the glacier and the sand waste
meet.
<span class = "desc">
He is silent again.
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
Halla has picked a flower and is pulling its petals.</span>
Why are you doing that? What are you asking about?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You love me!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Do you need to ask a flower about that?
<span class = "desc">(Rising.)</span>
Are you not the least bit sorry that we must part?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (rising).</span>
Would it make it easier for you, if I were to whine and weep like a
child?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I don't know.
<span class = "desc">(He is silent.)</span>
Yet you need not pity me. I&nbsp;am rich&mdash;I&nbsp;am king of the
hills! The fire on my hearth never dies, day or night. The country is
mine, as far as my eyes can reach. Mine are the glaciers that make the
streams! When I get angry, they swell, and the stones gnash their teeth
against the current. And I own a whole lake with a fleet of ice-ships
and a choir of swans.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I never said that I pitied you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
But one thing you must promise me. You must not marry the bailiff.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
But, dear man&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
If you do, I shall come some night and kill you both, first him and then
you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Are you really jealous of the bailiff? He hates me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Why should he be hounding me like a wild beast, if it were not for your

Yes, it is a long time.</p>

You may not often have wished to listen to others.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
Perhaps you are right, but somehow there must be two different souls in
every one of us.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Have you had a good hay crop this summer?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
Fairly good. At least I have enough for myself. Don't you understand
what I want to say to you, or don't you want to understand?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You said that it was a matter of weight. That is all I know.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
I am not skilled in fine words. Could you think of becoming my wife?
<span class = "desc">(Halla laughs. Bjørn flushes.)</span>
Is that so laughable?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You can't be in earnest.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
In dead earnest. I shall soon be forty-eight years old, but you are not
a child any longer either, and we are of equal standing. If we two marry
and make our farms into one, I&nbsp;think we should have to look outside
of this parish for a finer property.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
So we two should marry in order to join our farms?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
I will not deny that I should like to see the boundary line gone between
the two farms, but that is not the reason why I have made up my mind to
ask you to marry me. It is not good for a man to be alone, and you are
the only woman in this parish whom I could think of taking
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
for a wife. You are healthy and strong of body, and you are
good-looking. What answer do you give?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I must have some time to think it over. This comes upon me unawares.
Within three days you shall have my answer. Are you satisfied with
that?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
I think it is but natural that you should want some time to make up your
mind, and all the more as we have not always been the best of friends.
Perhaps you will now more readily understand why I did not wish you to
have a thief as overseer of your farm, and I am sorry to say that my
distrust was well founded.
<span class = "desc">(Pulls from his pocket a letter with a large
seal.)</span>
This letter came yesterday.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (holding out her hand).</span>
May I see it?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
It is an official letter, which I do not like to give out of my hands,
but I am not afraid to trust you with it.
<span class = "desc">(Halla takes the letter; reads.)</span>
I&nbsp;can lend you one of my men to drive your sheep home this evening,
for you will have to do without your overseer. It is lucky that the
judge is here to-day.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I shall keep this letter.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
I can understand a joke.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Kari has been with me for more than a year. He has been a hard worker
and an able man. I&nbsp;will not have any one lay hands on him so long
as he is in my service. I&nbsp;want to give him a chance to get away.
That is what you yourself advised, three months ago.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
At that time the case was very different. There was no proof of his
guilt then.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (putting her hand to her
forehead).</span>
I&nbsp;can't believe yet that he is a thief.
<span class = "desc">(Hands the letter to Bjørn.)</span>
Bjørn, I&nbsp;beg of you to show me a great favor. You must let this
matter rest, till we get home.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
In that I cannot serve you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Perhaps I can do something for you in return.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
I don't understand how you can pity a felon and a thief.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Nor do I understand it myself, but somehow I do. You have just asked me
if I would be your wife. Surely you will grant me the first thing I ask
of you!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
One would think you were pleading for your best friend.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I may have cared more for him than I knew myself. If you will let him
get away, I&nbsp;shall have no objection to making our two farms into
one.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
I never thought your overseer would be the means of my getting you for a
wife, but I yield on those terms. Once we are married, you will surely
forget him. But he must be gone from here within twenty-four hours, and
I want you to know that if he ever shows himself in these parts again,
he will have to take his punishment.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You need have no fear that he will ever come back here.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
Then let us forget all about him. You have saved him from jail for a
time, but he's sure to end there any way.

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
What have you done, Kari? It was to save you I promised to be his wife.
I&nbsp;hoped to get a chance to speak to you. He has the letter and is
going to give you up to the judge to-day.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I could not bear that man to touch you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You must run for the horses and flee!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
That would be madness. The others have just as good horses. We must take
what comes. I&nbsp;shall deny everything.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
What good would that do? It is impossible to mistake the description.
I&nbsp;have read it myself.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Did you really mean to marry the bailiff to save my life?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I lied to him, so that I could flee with you. I&nbsp;hate him.</p>

<span class = "desc">(Goes to her.)</span>
I&nbsp;believe it is God's will that you should not flee with me.
I&nbsp;have told you how beautiful it can be in the hills, but all the
terrors I have not told you of&mdash;the sand-storms, when the whole
plain seems to be on fire, the nights as long as a whole winter, and the
hunger stealing close to you like an evil mist. You might have come to

You say your name is Kari.
<span class = "desc">(Shows the letter.)</span>
According to this letter, your name is Eyvind, and you are an escaped

What does the judge say?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
In the early spring, a man came here who knew him
<span class = "desc">(pointing)</span>
as an escaped thief. I&nbsp;wrote to have the case looked up, and
yesterday I got the answer.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">The Judge.</span>
The description fits you. It is my duty under the law to take you into
custody.</p>

where it came from?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">44</span>

From the southland where you were born.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>

The seal is correct.

No. He has shown himself a trustworthy and an able man.

Don't you believe, as I do, that Kari is innocent?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">The Crowd (murmuring).</span>
Yes, yes!</p>

I cannot judge this case. I must send him to the district where Eyvind's

Can you vouch for him a few days? At present I cannot well spare two men

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I am not afraid to do that.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørn.</span>
It seems to me unwise to set a woman to watch a thief. If the judge
wishes it, I&nbsp;will take him into safe-keeping myself.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Does the bailiff think he can give counsel to the judge? I&nbsp;offer my
farm as surety for Kari.</p>

You must be crazy! I won't touch him.</p>

My dear brother-in-law made me a promise last spring that he would
wrestle with Kari here at the folds. It was a wager, and now he is
backing out of it. What do you say to that?</p>

An honest man does not play with a thief.</p>

A small grass-grown plot. In the foreground, to the right,
a&nbsp;fantastic lava formation, a&nbsp;hollow cone five yards in height
and three yards in circumference, once an enormous lava bubble produced
by gases in the liquid lava. In course of time, the roof has crumbled,
also the nearest wall. The farther wall is still standing, but there is
a hole in it, through which the sky can be seen. Farther back and
somewhat to the left, the wall of a small hut is seen, though partly
hidden by the lava formation. The hut is built of stone, the walls of
small stones chinked with sod, the roof of large lava slabs. To the
left, a&nbsp;deep gorge, the farther wall of which is so much higher
than the one near by that it completely shuts off the view to the left.
At the bottom of the gorge, a&nbsp;stream. Farther up, the gorge makes a
turn to the left, and here the upper part of a waterfall is seen. Behind
this, the glacier. On the grass plot is a hearth with a smouldering
fire. Some rocks covered with skins serve as seats. From the gorge comes
the murmuring sound of the waterfall.</p>

Then you can't be hungry.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
No.</p>

tea.</p>

One, two&mdash;four&mdash;six, seven&mdash;so many years your father and

When you are sixteen, we shall have lived here for twenty years, and
then we shall be free again. On that day, Tota shall wear snow-white
clothes and shoes of colored leather, and mother will clasp her silver
girdle around your waist. And when we come down to the lowlands, the
first one we meet is a young man with silver buttons in his coat. He
stops and turns his horse and stands looking after you ever so long.
Then your mother has grown old and wrinkled, and her hair is almost as
white as snow. Your father, too, has grown old. But you are straight as
a silver-weed, and when you run, you lift your feet high!</p>

<p class = "entrance">
Enter Kari and Arnes.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (laughing).</span>
Ah, now it's steaming. I&nbsp;nearly fell

Did you?
<span class = "desc">(Gives the straw to Tota.)</span>
Now you can go on by yourself.
<span class = "desc">(Rises.)</span>
Is there any need of closing the cave every time? When it's not raining,
it might be left open.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
No harm in being careful. If they should come upon us suddenly, we
surely should not have time to close the entrance, and they would find
the cave and destroy all our stores, as they did five years ago. Do you
remember when we came back to the old place and found nothing but
ashes?&mdash;and winter setting in. Not a single piece of mutton did
they leave us.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I don't easily forget.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Whenever I think of it, I feel like doing something wicked. After all,
we are human too.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (laughing coldly).</span>
We're only the foxes who take their sheep.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (to Arnes).</span>
How did you hide your stores when you were alone?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
I had many hiding-places. Once I stole some twenty-eight pounds of
butter. I&nbsp;stuffed it down into a fissure in a rock.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
That was pretty shrewd.</p>

<p class = "desc">
(They are silent.)</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Did you have a clear outlook from the mountain this afternoon?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Yes. There was a little mist far to the southward.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
It was from the south that the cloud came in my dream.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
You can never forget about that dream.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I counted fourteen men who came riding out of

the cloud.
<span class = "desc">(Silent for a moment.)</span>
You are quite sure the two men whose tracks you saw a month ago did not
get on our trail?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Quite sure. If they had, they would have come closer.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Just think if they had seen smoke and told about it down in the
parish!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
They have done nothing of the kind; for if they had, they would have
been up here with many men long ago. Ah, the water is boiling.</p>

<p class = "desc">

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Your tea will soon be giving out.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Yes, I must take a day and gather enough for the winter. I&nbsp;will go
down to the Sun Valley. Nowhere else are the herbs so fine.</p>

<p class = "desc">
(They drink their tea.)</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Don't forget to lay in a store of herbs for your salve. You know how
troublesome a little scratch can be, when the cold gets into it. You
kept the honey I found?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I did.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
That is good for wounds, too. And you must gather cotton grass for lamp
wicks.
<span class = "desc">(Goes to Tota and gives her tea.)</span>
Tota must have a taste, too.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes (has been looking at Halla).</span>
Your hair was quite black before, but now there has come a sheen of red
into it.</p>

I have not noticed it, but your freckles are all gone, I&nbsp;have seen
that.
<span class = "desc">(Patting her cheek.)</span>
Are you going to give us more tea?</p>

As much as you want.</p>

<span class = "desc">(rises and goes into the hut; returns with three
wooden pipes and two pouches, one large and one small)</span>

you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (smiling).</span>
It was foolish of you to teach me to smoke.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Why shouldn't you have that boon as well as&nbsp;I?
<span class = "desc">(Shakes his bag.)</span>
You need not be shy, I&nbsp;have more in the cave, and when winter sets
in and the snow is fit for skiing, we'll take Arnes down to my
brother's. He promised to lay in good stores of tobacco and salt, and I
will pay him with wool, as I did last time.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
If only you don't end by being caught on one of those journeys!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Never!
<span class = "desc">(They sit smoking in silence.)</span>
Now I am just in the mood to listen to a good story. Have you one to

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes (rising).</span>
No, I have not.
<span class = "desc">(Goes toward the gorge.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
It does not matter if you have told it before.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Arnes may be saving them for the winter.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (rises; lays down his pipe).</span>
Do you know what you should do? Have a good talk with Arnes.
I&nbsp;believe he is getting restless and thinks of leaving us.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I hope not.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I will go and take a bath. You can speak better to him alone, and I need

So I am.
<span class = "desc">(Halla rises; blows a great puff of smoke into his

Once there were two trolls. They quarrelled and turned each other into
stone. One had to stand where all the birds dropped their filth, and the
other had to stand where all the winds blew. Which would you rather
be?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (tears herself away).</span>
I&nbsp;have not been turned to stone yet.
<span class = "desc">(Laughs.)</span>
I&nbsp;thought you had forgotten all your old stories.</p>

You are strong.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (sits down on the grass, leaning on her
arm).</span>
Can you foretell things from the clouds?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
Yes, about the weather.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I don't mean that.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes (sits down beside her).</span>
When I was a child, I&nbsp;used to sail my viking ships on the clouds.
Do you want me to foretell your fate?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You just said that you could not.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
The clouds tell nothing about our lives. They are only the dreamlands of
earth. Will you let me see your arm?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Why?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes (lifts her arm).</span>
You think these lines on your arm are nothing but marks drawn by heather
and grass, but
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
if I knew enough, I&nbsp;could read your whole fate in them. Something,
perhaps, I&nbsp;can see. Who would believe that these slender arms could
be so strong.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (laughing).</span>
And what stands written there?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
You must sit still. Here is a deep, narrow line across your arm, that
means sorrow. And there is a big fire.
<span class = "desc">(Stroking her arm with the tips of his

Then you might tell me things I did not care to hear. But I must get to
work.</p>

If you are not too tired after the hunt, this skin can stand a little
more.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
It is queer about the sound of the waterfall. Most of the time I don't

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
Yes.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
At first I was almost afraid of it. Then I began to love it, and now I

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
No, that I cannot.</p>

Kari has been happy for seven years.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Are you sure of that?</p>

Why should he not be happy? He has a wife and child.</p>

Was there no one down your way whom you could bring with you up
here?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
Who do you think would become an outlaw for my sake?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Wouldn't you dare to carry off a woman? I&nbsp;should try my best to be
good to her.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
Do you think Kari would have dared to carry you off against your
will?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Ask him.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
Why does he not show it, if he cares so much for you? He forgets about
helping you with firewood and carrying water, and if the meat is not
cooked the way he likes it, he scolds you. One might think you were his
servant girl.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Don't let that worry you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
And he can't even see the color of your hair.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Do you bear a grudge against Kari, because he caught the swan?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
You had house and home and a good name, and you gave it all up for his
sake. He ought to keep that in mind more than he does.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I don't want Kari to be offering up thanks like a meek bondsman.
Besides, I&nbsp;have done nothing for him. I&nbsp;did it all for
myself.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You shall not touch it.</p>

My cursed mouth.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You judge me. How can you? You don't know what it means to bring a life
into the world. It grows heavier day by day like the snow of winter. If
we had had spring and sunshine! But the times were hard and food was
scarce. I&nbsp;did a good deed when I laid my child out in the cold. Far
less suffering that than life!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
I do not judge what you did.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
No, you thought I was an angel who was longing to be your harlot. You
can go with a lighted candle into my soul and search it. You will find
no remorse there. What could we have done with a child, if we had been
forced to flee? Should we have left it with strangers? And how do you
think it would have fared? A&nbsp;child of felons, scorned by all!</p>

Do you think I did it with a light heart? I&nbsp;have

given birth to two children, and cruel was the pain, but I would rather
bear ten children than live that night over again. When I had carried my
child out into the cold, my mind gave way. In my ravings, I&nbsp;thought
the child lay by my side, and above us was a flock of birds&mdash;pitch
black. I&nbsp;bent over it to shield it, and the birds pecked into my
back, into my lungs they pecked.

happy so long that it would be only fair if he had to die now. It seemed
to me that you and I were more akin in our souls, that we had more of
the wilds in us. I&nbsp;felt it was he alone that stood between us
two.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I forbid you to say another word. All your thoughts are lies. If Kari
had died, I&nbsp;should have followed him. You would have had my corpse,
not me. And if I had learned that you were the cause of his death,
I&nbsp;should have killed you while you were asleep. I&nbsp;have given
my all to my husband, even my conscience. I&nbsp;can go on living, even
if he should not always care so much for me, but when I no longer love
him, then I die.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Arnes.</span>
I am glad you love your husband. I don't know whether it is because I
have unburdened myself of all my evil thoughts, or whether it is because
I have made up my

mind to give myself up and serve my time, but I feel a peace within me
that I have not known for long. To-morrow I shall go away from here and
never come back. I&nbsp;shall tell Kari that I mean to take a short
trip.

A small hut in the hills. Two large stones covered with skins serve as
seats. The low bedstead is also covered with skins. On the wall hang
some poor, clumsy tools. In the slanting roof, a&nbsp;small window is
darkened with snow. On the hearth, a&nbsp;low fire. Outside,
a&nbsp;snowstorm. Now and then, snow comes whirling down the
smoke-hole.</p>

It's no use asking me about it.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>

I could well live a whole summer without the sun, if I only had food.

This fellow has not tasted meat in a whole eternity.
<span class = "desc">(A rapturous ring comes into his voice.)</span>

<span class = "desc">(Plants himself in front of Halla.)</span>
If he stood there now, bodily, should you have strength enough to hold

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I think I should.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
We should have to take care not to be too greedy. If we could only hold
back the first two days, we might eat as much as we wanted afterward.
<span class = "desc">(His mouth waters; he swallows saliva.)</span>

Yes, you hold your peace.

If I did not see your eyes, I&nbsp;should think you were dead, and yet

I want to be left in peace.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
You ought to be a tree, then you could wither in peace. Why don't you

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (in a weak voice).</span>
This cannot last. I&nbsp;should have gone long ago. I&nbsp;ought to have

that the morrow would bring fine weather. I&nbsp;know you said it to
soothe me, but it was not right.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
It was no use going to certain death.</p>

I should never be afraid of getting lost. If the snowstorm is ever so

Yes, I say that.</p>

Take care! You have tempted me to stay day after day. Your believing and

my courage. If we both die of hunger, the fault is yours, and yours
alone.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Is it my fault?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
You have lived in the hills for sixteen years, and you don't know them
more than a child does. Perhaps you think the snowstorm will have pity?
Won't you open the door and bid the snowstorm be still? Why don't
you?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (lets his arms fall. An expression of
sadness comes into his voice).</span>
I&nbsp;thought you were the only one who understood that I could not
help what I did. Neither could you help what you have done, and yet you
are bringing my misdeeds up against me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Never before have I upbraided you for this, but you put the whole blame
on me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
And you said it in such a hard tone. It was as if you struck me with
stones.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
My voice was no harder than yours.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
It's becoming in you to chide me, as if you had not yourself urged me to
steal many a time!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Since we became outlawed we have had a right to steal. We had to do it
to keep from starving.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I thought you had forgiven me, and then you have been hoarding your
charges. For sixteen years you have kept them, and they have not been

Come now, don't be angry, Kari. I said it in the heat of temper.</p>

When you go out of that door, you need not think of me any more.</p>

I know your voice when you are angry. You ought to thank me for going
out in such weather.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Yes, you are brave. It is not that you have any hope of saving our
lives. You will only lie down in the snow and die.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
You can believe it if you like.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (goes to him).</span>
I beg of you, let those hard words be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
It is not because of them that I am going. The worst that can befall me
is to die in the snow, and that is better than sitting here.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
First of all, we must use our common sense. The only thing we can do is
to wait here until the weather clears.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
And then the food will come flying in through the door!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Not that, but there will be means of help. We
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
can dig up roots to still the worst hunger, and we can go to the lake
for fish.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
The snowstorm may last four or five days yet, and by that time we shall
be dead from hunger.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
How long shall you be gone?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Two days at the most.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (goes to him and touches his

I&nbsp;beg you to stay for my sake! We have lived together for sixteen
years, and now let us also die together.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I know your way of hiding your will. Now it is your will that I should
stay, but this time you are foiled.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You cared for me when I fled with you to the hills. You told me there
was no one like me in all the world. You carried me across the streams,
until I grew strong enough to ford them myself. You risked your life to
get the things you knew I liked. Have you forgotten?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I have forgotten nothing.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
And all the nights we slept with the heavens above us! Was it not
blessed to feel the morning breeze over your face and to open your eyes
and look into the blue sky? Then you kissed me and said that you loved
me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
You shall not stop me from going.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (turns away from him).</span>
I&nbsp;know why I have this fear of being alone. It is because I am so
far away from every living thing, and there's no sun and no stream here.
<span class = "desc">(Turns toward him.)</span>
If we feel that we must die, you can close the smoke-hole, and I will
fill the hut with smoke. We shall lie down side by side.
<span class = "desc">(Touches his hand.)</span>
I&nbsp;will take your hand, and we shall dream that we are going out

Now leave me in peace.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">73</span>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
What do you hear?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I hear the sound of a great heavy waterfall. I&nbsp;hear the screams of
my child. You must not leave me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (turns away).</span>
You spare me nothing; you make my going as hard as can be.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I forbid you to go! It's inhuman to leave me here alone. If you ever
come back, you will find me a mad beast.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Now you shall keep still. I will not listen to your whining any
longer.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Have you gone mad?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You haven't the heart, but you have the heart to let me sit here all
alone. A&nbsp;wretched little train-oil lamp you would put out before
you went; you could not bear to let it burn over nothing.
<span class = "desc">(Sits down.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (stands silent a long time).</span>
I&nbsp;have been guilty of
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
many a bad deed, but so far as I know, I&nbsp;have never been cruel. Nor
will I be cruel to you.
<span class = "desc">(Takes off his coat.)</span>
Then we shall wait together as you wish. Does that make you feel
happier?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I don't know. I can feel neither joy nor grief any longer. I&nbsp;think
I would rather be alone.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
You don't mean that.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
If you think it wiser to go, you must do so.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I thought it would make you glad if I stayed.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (rising).</span>
If you had taken me in your arms and told me that you loved me with all
my wretchedness and all my homeliness, that would have made me glad; but
you did not.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Yet you know it was for your sake I stayed.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Are you so sure of that? Perhaps you were afraid that you might be
guilty of a wrong deed. I&nbsp;think you had in mind the Great Judge
rather than me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I have once been judged by men; that is why I so often think of the last
judgment.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I will have no talk of conscience between you and me. Be yourself with
me, whether you are good or bad. After all, you don't know if the Great
Judge looks kindly at what you call good deeds. Look at me! Look at me!
You could not be more cruel to your worst enemy. Why was I given this
hunger and not the food to still it? I&nbsp;have never wished to be
born. I&nbsp;would rather be anything else than a human being.
I&nbsp;would rather be the sand, whirling aimlessly over yonder waste.
If there is a God, He must be cruel&mdash;but there is no God.</p>

Don't say another word! We are wretched enough without your calling down
new curses upon us.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
I have but one sole and only wish before I die, and that is to do some
unheard-of cruel deed. I&nbsp;should like to be a snowslide.
I&nbsp;would come in the dead of night. It would be a joy to see the

"And it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place, when he

John also taught his disciples. And he said unto them, When ye pray,
say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth. Give us day by day
our daily bread. And forgive us our sins: for we also forgive every one
that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us
from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for
ever. Amen."</p>

You must not lose heart. When things are at the

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (kneeling).</span>
But, dearest Halla! Are you ill?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (warding him off).</span>
Let me alone.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (rises slowly).</span>
You were always so strong. I&nbsp;thought nothing could make you lose
heart.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (looks up. She has stopped crying; her

You don't love me any more. You have never loved me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Is that what you are crying for?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
Before when you wanted to leave me, I besought you by all the memories I
thought were dear to you. That did not touch you. I&nbsp;humbled myself
so low that I would have thanked you just for a little pity,&mdash;that
might have been an afterglow of your love, but you had no pity. You
stayed only because you were anxious about your own soul.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
I stayed also for your sake.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
You know better. You would rather die than have your God find you guilty
of an evil deed. You counted the saving of your soul higher than your
life, but I have no God, and I have never been able to tell my soul from
my love. If you had loved me, you would have understood that I was
pleading for my soul. You would have heard it in my voice, but you did
not hear it.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
You forget that it was to save our lives I wanted to go.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (rises. Her eyes are large and
burning).</span>
Why did you not take me with you?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
If I had gone alone, I might have come back alive. The two of us would
have been sure to perish.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (kneels).</span>
I&nbsp;once dreamed of two people. To them their love was the one and
only law. When they had lived a long life together, they were thrown
into direst need. Hunger drew near to the fine web that time had woven
between them and would tear it asunder. Then they looked into each
other's eyes, and together they walked out into the snowstorm to
die.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
It is every man's duty to keep alive as long as he can.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (rising).</span>
And why should it be, when life has become an agony to ourselves and of
use to no one?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
It is the law of God.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
The storm writes many laws in the sand.
<span class = "desc">(Sits down.)</span>
When my strength had given out, you could have left me in the snow.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
You know very well that I would never have done that.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla.</span>
That would have been better than to leave me waiting here. And I don't
believe that death is so hard. The storm carries you until you drop from
weariness, and then the snow comes and covers you up.
<span class = "desc">(Staring before her with eyes wide
open.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari (is silent for a moment).</span>
You are bitter, because of our sore plight. Many a time have I told
myself that I have been the curse of your life. If you had never known
me, you would now be living in peace and quiet. You could have ridden to
church every Sunday, if you liked. You would have been the rich and
comely widow with all the young men flocking about you. I&nbsp;dare say
you have often been sorry that you fled with me to the hills.
<span class = "desc">(Halla is silent.)</span>
I&nbsp;remember once we had been out hunting together all night. Early
in the morning we stood on the rim of the mountain
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
plain looking down upon the fields and the dwellings of men. On some of
the farms, the fires were lighted already, and the smoke rose straight
up into the blue air, and the streams ran so quietly and pleasantly
through the meadows. I&nbsp;thought then that I could see the
homesickness in your eyes.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (starting up, her voice cold and calm
again).</span>
If I could only have saved my faith in my own love, but I love you no
longer, and it may be that I never have loved you. As a child I used to
live more in my dreams than in the life about me. When I fled with you
to the hills, I&nbsp;thought it was because I loved you, but perhaps it
was only my longing for the strange and unknown. Afterwards, when the
days became harder and lonelier, my love for you was a shelter which I
would seek when sorrow for what I had done came clutching at my
heart.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Kari.</span>
Say no more! You are befouling our love&mdash;yours and mine. You say it
was only a longing for the unknown and the free, unfettered life that
made you flee with me to the hills. Shame on you!
<span class = "desc">(His voice is soft and full of sadness.)</span>
I&nbsp;know what you have been. No woman was ever greater in her love
than you. When the sun strikes the rim of the glacier, it takes on the
loveliest hues, though in truth it is nothing but dull, colorless clay.
So your love has been the sunlight in my life, and I love you&mdash;have
always loved you. When I was away from you even for a single day,
I&nbsp;would long to see you and hear your voice as eagerly as I would
long for the murmur of a brook when nearly dying from thirst. When I
went hunting and had good luck, I&nbsp;always thought of you. When I
pictured to myself how pleased you would be, I&nbsp;forgot all about my
weariness. But you must not ask the impossible of a man.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Halla (rising).</span>
I am cold. Will you fetch some wood?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">79</span>

The farm. Five white gables, all adjoining and separated by heavy
partitions. The roof is covered with turf, the walls are of earth and
stone. The gable farthest to the left is without a door, but has two
windows on the ground floor and a smaller window above. The next has a
door leading into the "badstofa" or servants' quarters. The third is a
dairy and storehouse; the fourth, a&nbsp;smithy; the fifth,
a&nbsp;drying-shed. In the yard is a horse-block; to the left,
a&nbsp;picket fence. Before the doors lie the packs unloaded from nine
horses: two green chests, sacks of grain and household stuff, lumber,
and a number of other articles. Jakobina stands feeling one of the
sacks. Helgi is undoing the strappings. The door to the smithy is open.
Einar is seen within, forging horseshoe nails.</p>

You step as lightly as a young foal. You are not hurt at what I said a

gossip about something else.
<span class = "desc">(Ljot goes to the fence, resting her hands on
it.)</span>
But that was not what I wanted to talk to you about.
<span class = "desc">(Goes to her.)</span>
You know Arne, the farmer at Skrida. You have seen his son Halfdan. What
do you think of him?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I have seen him only a few times.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
There are two brothers. The older one is married and is going to take
the farm, but Halfdan is most like his father. You should see the way
their place is kept. Their yard is nearly as big as this, and there are
long stretches where the grass stands so high that it falls over. It's
as fine a sight as I have ever seen. We stopped there, Jorunn
and&nbsp;I, for a full hour, on our way back from town, and there was no
lack of welcome. Can you guess what we talked about?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
No.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi (laughs).</span>
You can't? Arne asked me whether I would have his son Halfdan for a
son-in-law.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
And what did you say?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
I said I had nothing against it&mdash;quite the contrary. I&nbsp;should
be content if you had a husband like him, and we are getting old, your
mother and&nbsp;I. We don't know when death may strike us. It may come
at any time, and I should like to see the man who is to take my place
when I am gone.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I don't think you are getting old.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Oh, yes, I feel it. Sometimes when I want to use this or that for my
work I find that I have clean forgotten where I put it. That could never
have happened when I was young; there was not a thing that slipped my
mind. But what do you say, Ljot? Your mother thinks as I do, so it lies
solely with you whether you will accept this happiness or not.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I don't think I care for that happiness.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
You should weigh your words well before you speak. Perhaps you fancy
there will be a wooer like Halfdan coming every day. But you don't mean
that; you only mean that he must come and speak for himself.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I am so young, father.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
You are past nineteen. There are many girls who marry at seventeen, and
you have been so well taught that you can readily take your place at the
head of a household. I&nbsp;need not be ashamed of you there, that's
sure. And you will have your mother near you, for it is understood, of
course, that you and Halfdan stay here with us. You will have your
bridal now in the fall, and next spring you can take over the farm.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
But I scarcely know him at all!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Your mother did not know me, and I can't see but that we two have lived
happily together all these years. It is not always those who marry for
what they call love who are happiest. Arne and I are friends from old
times, and I have as good as given him my word.</p>

<p class = "entrance">

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot (straightening herself).</span>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Does he? You cannot say of Halfdan that he is a man you don't know.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
We have never spoken a word to each other.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Yet he has been here several times. Once he stayed overnight. Besides
you have heard him spoken of, and you know his people. Everybody knows
the Hofstad people.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
Father has given his word without asking me. He had no right to do
that.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
You have worked yourself up, Ljot. I don't understand you. Can it really
be that you have promised yourself to some one without letting your
parents know it?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I have not.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
You need not hide anything from me. If you have given your word, you
must keep it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I told you that I have not.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
You could not tell your old mother a falsehood! But if you are free and
not bound by any promise, this puzzles me. Halfdan is young and a
capable man, and his father is one of the richest and most respected
farmers in the countryside.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
But I don't care for him. You can't mean that I should marry a man I
don't care for.
<span class = "desc">(Leans over the fence.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Once you are married you will come to care for him.
<span class = "desc">(Goes to her.)</span>
It is a great step you are about to take. Weigh your words well, so that
you may not rue them. Be careful not to thrust away happiness when she
reaches out her hand to you, or there may come a day when you will
repent. You must know that your parents wish nothing but what is good
for you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot (with tears in her voice).</span>
It seems to me you are against me, both you and father.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn (stroking her hair).</span>

know what it is. You were very much pleased with the bird's skin you got
to-day.
<span class = "desc">(Ljot is silent.)</span>
The winter your father asked me in marriage there came to my home a man
who used to go from farm to farm doing odd carpenter jobs. One evening I
carried his coffee to him where he was at work. He had a big chest
standing there that he kept his tools in. I&nbsp;can remember it
plainly; it was yellow. I&nbsp;stood waiting for him to finish his
coffee so that I could take the cup back, when he took out of the chest
a work-box&mdash;the prettiest thing I've ever seen. It was of dark
brown wood, the lid round, with pictures of animals carved on it. He
made me a present of it, and when I was about to go, he asked me for a
kiss, but I would not give it to him.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
You never told me about this.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
He was a good-looking man, with big brown eyes. Well, when your father
came, my father and mother both wanted me to become his wife. It was not
altogether easy for me, but I would not go against their wishes.
I&nbsp;thought it my duty to please them, and besides the other man had
never asked me straight out.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
But he was the one you cared for.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Perhaps I thought so at the time.
<span class = "desc">(Silence.)</span>
He went away on the night he heard that I was promised to your father.
A&nbsp;year after I married your father, he was drowned&mdash;some
thought he had taken his own life.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
Maybe that was your doing.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
How can you say such a thing to your mother!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
Don't be angry with me, mother.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
A man who cannot bear his fate is not worth much. I&nbsp;should not have
been happy as his wife, and I could not wish for a better man than your
father. When two people live together a whole lifetime and have an
honest will to do what is right by each other, they will come to care
for each other, as the years go by.
<span class = "desc">(Silence.)</span>
I&nbsp;have told you this so that you may think it over, but if you feel
in your own heart that it is right to go against the wishes of your
parents, then you will have to do so.
<span class = "desc">(Ljot is silent.)</span>
You say nothing, my child? I&nbsp;have tried as best I could, in my poor
way, to do what seemed my duty. I&nbsp;cannot give my daughter any other

too, there is nothing else that can bring you peace.</p>

was like cutting into a living thing&mdash;like skinning a live
animal.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Rannveig.</span>
Ugh, yes.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Jon.</span>

scar.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Did you meet anybody when you came home from work?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Indridi.</span>
No.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
And no outsider has been here this afternoon. They don't come when they
are wanted. I&nbsp;ought to have sent one of you to the next farm to
find out how things were there, anyway.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jon.</span>
I can easily go yet, if mistress wants me to.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Oh, no, it's getting late. I hope we shall have no bad tidings from any
one.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Indridi.</span>
I hope so, too.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jon.</span>
I'm afraid the Vik farm-house has fallen. It is both old and poorly
built&mdash;nothing like ours.</p>

<p class = "desc">
(Silence.)</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar.</span>
You should have seen the hawks, Jorunn, right after the shock. They kept
flying back and forth, just as they do when they're warding off a foe
from their nest.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
They were frightened.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar.</span>
And no wonder. Great pieces of rock came tumbling down into the creek.
The sheep out on the heath yonder huddled together in flocks, looking
like old snow.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jon.</span>
Then you were out hunting.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar.</span>
No, I was not hunting. I was looking at the hawks, wondering whether one
could get at them by going down in a rope.</p>

<p class = "desc">
(Silence.)</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
What about the boy, Sveinungi? Do you mean to let him stay with the
sheep all night?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Certainly. He can sleep to-morrow.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
I was only thinking he might be afraid to be alone.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
He's no more afraid than grown people.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
I saw he took both the dogs with him.</p>

<p class = "desc">

<p><span class = "speaker">Helgi.</span>
There was a man walking across the <i>hraun</i> a little while ago. Who
can it be?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Indridi.</span>
I saw him too.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jon.</span>
It was Sølvi. He carried his gun.</p>

<p class = "desc">

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
How still it is on the <i>hraun</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar.</span>
I thought you were listening for something, while you lay there quiet as
a mouse. I&nbsp;thought you were listening for the earthquake.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Frida.</span>
Can one hear the earthquake when it is coming?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Rannveig.</span>
Are you afraid? Yes, sometimes it can be heard a little before the
shock. They say it sounds like the clatter of hoofs from many hundred
horses.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Bjørg.</span>
To me it sounded like the whistling of the wind.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
You should sit down, Sveinungi. You'll get tired standing.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
I am not tired.</p>

<p class = "desc">
(Silence.)</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Frida.</span>
What if the earth should open up right here where we are sitting?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Rannveig.</span>
It won't. Who told you that it might?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Frida.</span>
Jakobina said so.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Rannveig.</span>
You must not listen to all she says; she talks so much.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jakobina.</span>
I say nothing but what is true. At the time of the last great earthquake
the ground cracked and made a
<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
fissure many miles long; I&nbsp;saw it myself. The earth opened her
mouth to breathe.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar (to Frida).</span>
Don't be afraid. I&nbsp;have a black lamb&mdash;do you remember
it?&mdash;with white feet. When I get it home in the fall, I&nbsp;will
give it to you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jakobina (facing the "hraun").</span>
Not one of you knows the <i>hraun</i> as I do. Can you tell me why the
hollows out there are never filled with snow? Have you ever seen the
snow falling fast enough to cover even the rims around them? It's the
earth blowing her breath against it. The earth sets traps for men; the
earth is a man-eater.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn (to Jakobina).</span>
You must not frighten the child.</p>

<p class = "desc">
(Silence.)</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Wasn't it you, Jakobina, who said that sometimes blood comes on the
window-panes? It bodes ill, they say.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jakobina.</span>
Why do you ask? There is no one here who has seen it, is there?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Never mind why I ask.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jakobina.</span>
Well, if I must say it, it is a sign that some one in the house is going
to die soon.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Or it might bode ill to the farm itself, maybe.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jakobina.</span>
What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
That it might be doomed.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Indeed, it means neither the one nor the other. It's nothing but a silly
old superstition.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Not that I believe in it, but look at the windows. Don't they look as if
they were wet with blood?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
It's the sun shining on them.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
And see the gables, how white they are. They don't look whiter from the
fields down yonder when you spread a cloth over them to call me
home.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Indridi (lowering his voice).</span>
Did you see the sheep-cot fall?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Thora.</span>
Yes, it happened just as we came out.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Indridi.</span>
What did Sveinungi say?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Thora.</span>
He said nothing.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Indridi.</span>
But he told us to move out here.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Thora.</span>
No, it was Jorunn who made us do it.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi (to Jorunn).</span>
I did not tell you that when I came into the <i>badstofa</i>, right
after the shock, our old clock had stopped running.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Was it broken?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
No, when I touched the pendulum it started again, but the place was
still as death when I entered. The grass on the roof cast a shadow over
the skylight. It was as quiet as when my father lay dead.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
I think we had better go and lie down. There's nothing gained by staying
here any longer.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
I can't see that there was any need of moving out, but you had your way,
Jorunn.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
I feel sure that they have done the same on all the other farms. We must
be thankful it is summer, so that we can stay outdoors.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Must we be thankful? So you give thanks that my work is ruined.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
We must take what comes, whether good or evil, and trouble may help us
to remember all the things we have neglected to give thanks for.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
I don't know but that I have always done my duty. I&nbsp;have built all
the sheep-cots; I&nbsp;have fenced in the land and looked after it as
best I could. I&nbsp;demand justice of Him up there.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn (rising).</span>
I won't listen to such talk. Did you buy
<span class = "pagenum">104</span>
the land from Him, perhaps? And what did you have to pay with that was
not His already?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
You needn't mock me. You can walk all over the yard and cut your handful
of grass with your scissors wherever you like; it grows thick as wool
everywhere, and it's all my work.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>

did not swallow up the bit of ground you are standing on, which you call
yours?

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Do you remember the night you thought I was lost in the snowstorm?
A&nbsp;light was burning in the upper window. To see it was better than
meeting a human being, and when the dogs began to bark behind the door,
it was just as if the house itself were speaking&mdash;calling out its
joy. It sounded better to me than a human voice, and when I stepped into
the hall, the darkness seemed to put its arms around me. Never have I
had so sweet a welcome, not even when my daughter was a little
child.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Ought we not to go in, Sveinungi? It's getting late. You too must go in
now, Ljot.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I am only waiting for father.</p>

I am not going to stay in the tent to-night. I&nbsp;am going home.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
But, father dear!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
I won't let any foolish fear drive me out of my house, and it is nothing
but a foolish fear. The earthquake will not come so suddenly but that I
shall have time to get out. It's impossible. Besides, the
<i>badstofa</i> will hold. It's well built, though it's old.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Do you think the <i>badstofa</i> will hold if there should come a big
earthquake? You cannot mean that!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
It is not at all sure there will be another shock. It's only a fancy
that the earthquake must needs keep on once it has begun. I&nbsp;believe
it is over; I&nbsp;feel it.
<span class = "desc">(During the last speeches the Servants have been

What are you running out for? Go in, all of you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jakobina.</span>
I must tell master about the dream I had. It was last night.
I&nbsp;thought I was standing out in the yard and saw a giant coming
across the <i>hraun</i>. He walked with long, unsteady strides
<span class = "desc">(she takes a few steps forward; her voice sounds
distant and threatening)</span>,
and seemed to grope as if he were blind. Then I saw him standing right
by the house&mdash;with arms stretched out; he bent down over the farm
and stood there like a stone cross.
<span class = "desc">(Makes the sign of the cross with her
arms.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Did I ask you to tell me about your dream?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
I beg of you, Sveinungi, that you do not stay at the house to-night. It
would be tempting God.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
It's rather He who is tempting me. If I ran away, it would serve me
right to have the house fall down.
<span class = "desc">(Pointing to the house.)</span>
There it has stood waiting for me every evening as far back as I can
remember. I&nbsp;have seen the windows flaming in the sun. I&nbsp;have
seen them wet with rain. I&nbsp;have seen them white with frost. I've
been with it ever since I was a child. I&nbsp;have climbed on the roof
as I climbed on my father's shoulders. When I stood on the ridge, it
seemed it had lifted me up to let me see better. No, Jorunn, even if I
knew the earthquake to be coming, I&nbsp;should go home. Nor is it any
wonder that I long to get into my own bed. I&nbsp;am old now, and I have
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
waked up there almost every morning of my life. I&nbsp;have gone to bed
so tired and worn that I could barely stand on my feet and have waked up
young and strong. I&nbsp;have been ill and have lain there watching the
sunbeams flitting across the floor.

In olden times, they say, there was an underground stream that ran
straight through the country from south to north and was meant as a sign
of truce between land and sea. It happened that a cross-eyed,
ill-natured shark was trying to tempt a young whale to swim that stream
from end to end. The whale's name was Spray-tail. He was the handsomest
of all the young whales and could shoot three jets of water at once. The
shark boasted that he had swum through the stream himself, but of course
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
it was only real fishes that could do it. Spray-tail felt stung on
behalf of his kin, and as the shark had told him that there were
openings here and there in the roof of this underground way, he made up
his mind to try his luck, trusting that he could hold his breath from
one opening to another. But it fell out otherwise. Spray-tail never came
back. The last ever heard of him was that some swans, in their flight
over the hills, had seen a jet of blood spurting out of the ground.</p>

<p>The whales were in a rage and, as they thought in their grief that
the land had broken truce, they goaded the sea to wreak vengeance upon
it. Are you listening?</p>

<p class = "desc">
(Ljot nods her head.)</p>

<p>One night a dreadful storm broke. The sea came rushing in over the
land, fell upon the rocks like a monster, and tore them to pieces. The
next morning thousands of sea fowls' nests were wrecked, and where green
fields had been there were black sands. Now there was sore need of wise
counsel. A&nbsp;shrewd old raven said that the fire should be roused.
All the birds agreed that the raven had spoken well, but none dared do
the deed. The raven was made judge, and decided that the spider should
undertake the ticklish task, and that the eagle should carry her to the
crater.</p>

<p>They gave the spider ten fat blue-flies to take with her. She spun
herself well and firmly under some strong feathers, and off they went.
They flew over deep dales, over dreary wastes, and over glaciers. In the
evening they came to the fire-mountain, and there they rested overnight,
but they did not sleep much, for the fire was snoring like a giant down
below in the earth. Early the next morning the eagle flew to the top of
the mountain. The spider made fast her thread
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
and spun herself slowly down into the crater. It was dark down there,
and the heat and sulphur made her eyes smart, but she could see enough
to make out that the fire lay sleeping under a very thin black coverlet.
The spider knew nothing but the finger-language, and she moved her legs
incessantly, telling fully and truly all about the havoc that was
wrought, and urging the fire to come to the rescue lest the whole land
be swallowed up by the sea. Yet the fire did not stir. Then the spider
bent her legs up under her and let herself fall all the way down to the
fire. She stretched out one leg and poked the black coverlet. From that
moment she couldn't remember anything till she was lying at the rim of
the crater again. She peeped down and saw that the fire had thrown off
the coverlet and was red and blazing. Then the spider understood that
her task was done. Everybody knows how the fire had its reckoning with
the sea and filled up whole fjords with lava and ashes.</p>

to the house, mother went with him.</p>

But the buildings may fall at any moment if there should be another

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar.</span>
Sveinungi knows that as well as we do, but he would not let the house
stand forsaken.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
We must hope that no harm will come to them. So that is why you are
still up. Have the others been in bed long?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
No, they went in a little while ago.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar.</span>
May I look at your gun?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
As much as you like.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar.</span>
Is it loaded?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
It is.
<span class = "desc">(To Ljot.)</span>
You are not angry with me for coming so late? It seemed an eternity till
Sunday.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I knew you would come.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
You knew it! Won't you sit down? I have something to show you.
<span class = "desc">(Ljot sits down. Sølvi opens the game-bag; takes

I&nbsp;found this out on the <i>hraun</i>. Is it not beautiful?
<span class = "desc">(Sits down.)</span>
Look, the stem is no thicker than a hair, while the leaf can easily hide
your whole face.
<span class = "desc">(Holds it up before her face.)</span>
It trembles when your breath touches it.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
You have pulled it up by the roots. May I have the moss that came with
it?
<span class = "desc">(Sølvi loosens the moss from the roots. Ljot lays
it in her hand; smiles.)</span>
When it withers, I'll keep it in my shoes.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
Will you keep it in your shoes? See these two small ferns on one root.
They look like two slim hands.
<span class = "desc">(Looks at Ljot.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar (puts the gun aside).</span>
It's a fine one. It must have cost a good deal. Perhaps you bought it
yourself abroad?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
I did.
<span class = "desc">(Lays down the fern. To Ljot.)</span>
If you have time, you can plant it to-morrow. It won't hurt it to lie
overnight in the wet grass.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar (goes to Sølvi).</span>
How long were you abroad?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
Seven years.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar.</span>
That's a long time.
<span class = "desc">(Sits down.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
My father was angry with me for keeping your bird's skin.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
Was he? And I was thinking of asking you to visit me at Hol some time
before I leave.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I hardly think I dare to.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
You could take Einar with you. It is not much more than an hour's ride,
and I have a number of things I should like to show you,&mdash;petrified
tree-trunks that I have dug out of the earth, in which you can see
plainly every bud
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
and shoot, and stone slabs with impressions of flowers and leaves that
lived thousands of years ago. Should you like to see them?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I should like it ever so much.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
I have some rocks, too, baked by fire and furrowed by ice. If you knew
all the tales they tell me! They lay bare to me things that are hidden
from every one else.</p>

<p class = "desc">
(A whirring of wings is heard far away.)</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar (stands up, pointing with his

Look, there is a flock of ducks flying over the <i>hraun</i>.
<span class = "desc">(Stands gazing.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi (in a low voice).</span>
It made me so happy to see you. This evening, when the sun was setting,
I&nbsp;reached out toward it. I&nbsp;did the same when I saw you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar.</span>
They're flying unusually low. There they alight&mdash;I'll get my
gun.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi (rising).</span>
I'll lend you mine.
<span class = "desc">(Hands him the gun.)</span>
It will carry a distance of a hundred and thirty feet.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar.</span>
What size shot have you?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
Duck-shot.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Einar.</span>
Ljot, you don't mind, do you? I shall not be gone long. If they rise,
I'm not going after them.
<span class = "stagedir">

<p class = "desc">

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi (goes to her).</span>
My star must be in the heavens to-night.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
You must not think that I was sitting up so late because I was waiting
for you&mdash;I&nbsp;saw you walking over the <i>hraun</i>&mdash;but we
shan't talk about that.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
Shall I tell you why I came home from abroad? It was for your sake.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot (sits down).</span>
That is not true.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi (sits down).</span>
One night, the last winter I was away, I&nbsp;must have been dreaming,
but it seemed to me that I was
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
awake. I&nbsp;had come back home and was walking on the <i>hraun</i>.
The <i>hraun</i> was covered with ashes. As I walked, I&nbsp;suddenly
fell into a deep cleft and kept on falling and falling. At last I found
myself lying on the bottom, unable to stir. Death came and sucked the
life out of my eyes and held it in her hand like a tiny flame. Suddenly
a woman stood beside me dressed in moss. She pleaded for me so long that
death gave her my life. She looked like you. It was you. Don't you know
that you hold my life in your hands?</p>

<p class = "desc">
(They rise.)</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I think I shall go in. It is hard to tell when Einar will be back. When
he is out hunting he forgets everything.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
I love you, Ljot! You have not been out of my thoughts since the first
time I saw you. Everything reminds me of you&mdash;the sun, the
sky&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I too have been happy in seeing you and talking with you.
<span class = "desc">(Stands still as death.)</span>
This morning, right after you had gone, my father told me that on his
way home from town he had seen his old friend,&mdash;and my father
wanted me to promise myself to the son of his old friend, but I would
not, because I was thinking of you. Then my mother came and talked to
me&mdash;and I gave in. I&nbsp;could not do anything else.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
Why did I not speak before! You won't feel hurt at what I say, Ljot? You
must not let your parents decide your life. That is for you to do.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
You don't know my father. If he thought I was standing here talking to
you, I&nbsp;can't tell what he would do.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
I am convinced your parents have but one wish, and that is for your
happiness.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I don't know. My mother does not say much about
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
happiness; she does her duty&mdash;and I know mine.
<span class = "desc">(Turns toward the tent.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
Are you going?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
It is better that we two should not meet again&mdash;it would only cause
us suffering.
<span class = "desc">(Moves away.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi (following her).</span>
You don't realize what you are about to do! You will be committing a
terrible crime&mdash;against all the wonderful days that life meant us
two to have together. For you do care for me, Ljot, don't you?
<span class = "desc">(Ljot is silent.)</span>
I&nbsp;thought you cared for me. When you spoke to me this morning you
blushed, and I thought it was your heart that gave me its promise. The
joy of it overwhelmed me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
It matters little whom I care for. I have given my word.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
You think it is your duty to keep your word, but there is another duty
that is far greater, and that is to open your arms to happiness when it
comes. There is no greater duty. It is the meaning of our existence. You
must feel that, you who have grown like a flower out of the earth!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
It is not only that I have given my word. If I had neither father nor
mother, I&nbsp;should break my promise, but I know that it would grieve
my parents. This morning father said to me that it was the happiest day
of his life since he got my mother, and I know it was true.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
You must tell your parents that you cannot keep your word. You must do
it for my sake.
<span class = "desc">(Kneeling.)</span>
You are the only one I care for in all the world.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
I can't deal such a blow to my father. No other living being has been so
good to me as my father.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi (rising).</span>

It won't. It is drift-timber, which never rots.</p>

out how you had fared; I&nbsp;could not help it.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
You feel proud that you have coaxed a young girl to break her word. You
think yourself very brave, and you have taken advantage of her when she
was beside herself
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
with fear. You have come like a thief in the dead of night.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
I love your daughter. There is nothing wrong in that, and I am proud and
happy that she has given me her heart.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi (to Ljot).</span>
So that is what you have done. I&nbsp;dare say you have met him before
and more than once behind my back.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
Not once.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
And straightway you are ready to break your word. You knew that
Halfdan's father is the best friend I have.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
You must forgive me, father!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
And you knew I had sent him word that everything was settled.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot (takes his hand).</span>
Do you remember, father, when I was so little that I had to put my arms
around your knee? Then you never said no when I asked you for anything.
I&nbsp;am still your little girl.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Let me go!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
You do care for me, father. I know of no one who has been so good to me
as you. You have given me everything that I call my own. You must give
me my happiness!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Let go my hand!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
I understand that Sølvi is very dear to you, my child, but this comes
upon us unawares, and it has been a terrible night for us all.
<span class = "desc">(To Sølvi.)</span>
Could you not have waited before speaking to Sveinungi?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
I cannot help it that it has come in this way. I&nbsp;would have waited
if I could.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
I might perhaps have seen my way to put in a good word for you two.
<span class = "desc">(To Sveinungi.)</span>
You won't be hard
<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
on your daughter! If we had been lying under the ruins now, she would
have had no need to ask us. To-night we must not be merciless.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Who is this man? I don't know him, nor do I know his people.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
My father was a farmer like yourself. Had he been living, you two might
have become friends.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi (interrupting).</span>
The only thing I know about you is that you go about picking up stones
like the children.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
You speak slightingly of my stones, but the knowledge I gain from them
can bring me more money than you ever made on your farm, and it can
bring me fame.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
What kind of knowledge is that?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
Those stones teach me to know my country and how it has been built by
fire and water and ice. They give me an opportunity of finding out new
links in laws that are eternal and mightier than all mankind.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Indeed! Since you are so passing wise, you ought to have told me days
ago that a great earthquake would come to-night. <i>That</i> I could
have understood; but it seems that you knew as little there as the rest
of us. I&nbsp;believe old Jakobina is wiser than you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
I don't know how wise she is, but I do know of people who go through
life as if they were blind. They may have been living in the same place
all their lives, and yet they have never seen the landscape they live
with&mdash;neither its beauty nor its peculiar character.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
They haven't?
<span class = "desc">(Points toward the "hraun.")</span>
I&nbsp;have been out there in a snowstorm so heavy that I could scarcely
see a hand before me, and shall I tell you how I found my way?
I&nbsp;knew where I was by feeling before me with my hands.
<span class = "desc">(Laughs.)</span>
No, I&nbsp;have never seen the <i>hraun</i>!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
I did not say that you were among the blind, and I am sure you are human
enough not to force your daughter to marry against her will. It would
not give you much joy to feel that you had made her unhappy for her
whole life. If you think you do not know me well enough, you can find
out all you wish from myself or from others.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
I have no desire to learn anything about you, and you need not worry
about my daughter. She will stay here with me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
Ljot is not a child any longer. She can decide for herself.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Perhaps you think she can't live without you.
<span class = "desc">(To Ljot.)</span>
If you care as much for him as he imagines, I&nbsp;will let you prove
it. I&nbsp;will let you choose between him and me. If you choose him,
then I have no daughter any more.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
You don't mean to force me to such a choice!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Can you for a single moment be in doubt about whom to choose of us
two&mdash;him or your old father?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot (kneeling).</span>
He is so unutterably dear to me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Get up! I don't want to see you lying like a dog at my feet.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot (rising).</span>
Then you have no daughter.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
I knew you would not fail me!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
You had better give your consent, Sveinungi, since it cannot be
otherwise. I&nbsp;cannot do without my only child.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi (goes to Ljot).</span>
You are quite free, Ljot; I&nbsp;will not try to force you, but when you
have thought it over, you will not leave your father and mother for the
sake of a stranger. You are my only child, and you have been the light
of my eyes since you were a little tot. When I came home from work I was
never too tired to listen to what
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
you had to say. When you stroked my cheek it was like warm summer rain
falling on my face. It will be lonely and empty here if you go. You
cannot do it.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
Father, it is you who drive me away.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
You must listen to me. It has always been my intention that you should
take the farm, and yesterday when you promised to marry Halfdan it
seemed to me that all my wishes had been fulfilled. I&nbsp;was happy,
and not only for your sake, but fully as much for the farm. Yet you
would leave it now in the midst of misfortune. Look about you! Not a
single building is standing. Can you let your old father sit here alone
and forsaken? You might as well kill your father. And for whom should I
build it up again if you are not to have it? It might as well be left to
rot on the ground.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ljot.</span>
You don't know, father, how much I care for him. I&nbsp;used to dream
often that the mountains fell so that I could see the land beyond.
To-night it seemed to me that the mountains fell.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
You are a wilful girl.
<span class = "desc">(To Sølvi.)</span>
Could you think of taking over my farm, perhaps?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
I could not&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi (interrupting).</span>
Do you two believe that you can cow me?
<span class = "desc">(Pointing to the ruins.)</span>
There is a chest of drawers in there that Ljot keeps her clothes in.
I&nbsp;will have nothing of hers in my house.
<span class = "desc">(To Sølvi.)</span>
Will you go in there with me and bring it out?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi.</span>
I have nothing to do in there.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
You can go, Ljot. I can't bear to see you.
<span class = "desc">(Goes over to the ruins; stands resting his hands
on the walls.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sølvi (takes Ljot by the hand
quietly).</span>
It is better that we leave your parents alone for a little while.
<span class = "stagedir">
Exeunt.</span></p>

<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
You will have to give your consent, Sveinungi. You say yourself that all
you have done has been for your daughter.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi (turns to Jorunn, passing his
earth-stained hand over his forehead).</span>
Did you understand what I was about to do? I&nbsp;wanted to get him into
the ruins, and then I meant to give the post a shove.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
God forgive you, man!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Now we two must hold together. If we two are of one mind, I&nbsp;believe
Ljot will give in. You must try to bring her to her senses.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
They are very fond of each other. It warmed my heart to see them. It
brought back the days of my own youth. I&nbsp;feel sure it would be a
sin to try to part those two.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
And you say that!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
I think it was her fate to meet this man. She has always been a good and
dutiful daughter.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
And it was you who went with me into the house! Have you turned against
me&mdash;you too?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn (goes to him).</span>
You must not make the evil worse than it really is. The man looks as if
he came of good people, and we have every reason to believe that he is a
capable man. Even if we can't keep Ljot here, as we had hoped to do, she
will certainly find time to come and see us once in a while, and we
shall have that to look forward to.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
You think only of your daughter. It is nothing to you if my life-work is
wasted. I&nbsp;could name you many farms that have been an ornament to
the neighborhood as long as they have been handed down from man to man
in the same family, but once they have passed into other hands, they
have been tended in a makeshift way or left to go to rack and ruin
altogether. You have seen those
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
old forlorn places, where the site is overgrown with grass, and the
heather has been allowed to spread all over the yard. They remind me of
graves. I&nbsp;tell you the truth: if such a fate were in store for my
farm, I&nbsp;should wish for nothing but to be lying under the ruins
myself.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Who says that your farm will not be rebuilt! You are not so old that you
cannot do it without help. If I know you rightly, you always grow
younger and stronger whenever there is anything that needs all your
powers. In a year or two you will have the buildings up again every bit
as fine as before.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Spare your wheedling! What would be the use, even though I got the
houses up again? When my days are over, everything will pass into the
hands of careless people. And to think that this should happen only
because of a fleeting fancy!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Did it seem to you like a passing whim when Ljot was begging for your
consent? To me it seemed that she was pleading for her life.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Even though this should mean more to my daughter than I think it does,
that can alter nothing. It is my right to care for my home and keep it
intact even after I am gone. When I am standing out in the <i>hraun</i>
and looking toward home, the green yard looks like a spot of
sunshine.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
You take it for granted that none of your kin will ever reap the benefit
of your work, but your daughter is not dead, though she has chosen
another man than the one you wanted her to marry. Why should not those
two have children? They are both strong and healthy, and there is, after
all, a&nbsp;chance that some day one of their sons may take over the
farm.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
I dare say a son of his would be the right man!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
A daughter's son is often more like his grandfather than his father. You
know that as well as I.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
You are like a child playing with soap-bubbles. When one breaks, you are
straightway ready to blow a new one. You can't make me play at that
game. Even though they should have children, do I know how they would
turn out? And you see it the same way yourself, but you are trying to
fool me into giving my consent.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
What do you gain even if you have your way and part those two? You may
bring it about that your daughter becomes one of those sour old maids;
for you cannot mean to drag her to the altar against her will.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
I didn't expect you to be against me. You wouldn't mind leaving the
farm, if you could live with your daughter. You care more for her than
for me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn (her voice growing husky).</span>
Why do you say this, Sveinungi? I&nbsp;have never weighed my feelings
for you two, nor do I intend to do it. I&nbsp;only know that where you
are, there I stay too.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Even this very earth upon my hand is dear to me. I&nbsp;care for it as
the old house-leek would if she could feel. As for the young man whom
you think so much of, I&nbsp;should have grudged him even to have the
earth fall on his face. But you were not born here, as I was. You have
not lived here as a child. You are an outsider.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Am I an outsider! I am grown too old to kneel before you as your
daughter did, but if you send her away, I&nbsp;know that even though you
build your house both larger and finer, the room will seem less light to
me, and the smile will be gone from my face. Can you not spare me the
sorrow of losing my only child?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
I thought you knew me well enough not to tease me with bootless prayers.
What I have said stands.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
I don't know what gives you the right to be so heartless. You were
tempting God when you went into the house, but He had mercy on you and
spared your life, and the very first thing you do is an act of cruelty.
<span class = "desc">(Bursts out sobbing.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Don't take to crying, wife.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn (weeping; sits down on one of the
stones that have been torn from the wall by the earthquake).</span>
I&nbsp;don't see how I am going to live through it if you send her
away.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi (stands puzzled for a moment, then
goes to her).</span>
I&nbsp;understand that you take this very much to heart. Do go into the
tent now and lie down. We must try to get over this as best we can.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn (rising).</span>
I am sure I have lost my daughter forever.
<span class = "desc">(Weeps.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi (takes her hands and kisses her on
the cheek).</span>
I&nbsp;have always said good night to you with a kiss. You have been a
good wife to me. I&nbsp;little thought, when you went with me into the
house, that you should cry yourself to sleep this very night because of
me.
<span class = "desc">(Jorunn clings to him, weeping. Sveinungi releases
himself suddenly.)</span>
Listen to what I say. You shall not leave me this way. Now you can go to
the young folks and tell them that I give my consent.
<span class = "desc">(Moves a little away.)</span>
But it will be on one strict condition.
<span class = "desc">(Jorunn wipes her eyes on her apron.)</span>
They must promise me that if they have a son, he shall be brought up
here with us.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn (her face lighting up).</span>
I&nbsp;believe this thought was sent you by Him who showed mercy upon
you this night.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Even if it should be their only child.
<span class = "desc">
Goes
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
to Jorunn.</span>
And you can tell them that it is only for your sake I yield. Now you
won't cry any more?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
God bless you! How happy Ljot will be!
<span class = "desc">(Turns to go.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
You needn't be in such a hurry. I don't care to have the young folks see
that you have been crying. And one thing more; Sølvi must not come here
until I send him word. I&nbsp;want to explain to my old friend how all
this has come about.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn.</span>
Sølvi will understand.
<span class = "desc">(Sits down, very still, with her hands in her lap,
gazing straight before her.)</span>
And the boy is to be named Sveinungi.
<span class = "desc">(Unconsciously she passes her right hand back and
forth over the edge of the stones.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sveinungi.</span>
Yes, they can well be used again, the old stones. Now you had better go
to Ljot.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Jorunn (rising, pats his arm).</span>
Yes, yes, I&nbsp;am going, and I am happy.
<span class = "stagedir">
Exit.</span></p>

but more living than he because more subtly studied in his moods of
weakness as well as in his exultation of strength. <i>Dial.</i></p>

eighty-three Illustrations and seven Maps. 1914. xxi + 304 pages. Price

<p class = "smaller">
There has always been a peculiar fascination for the student of American
history in that chapter of it which deals with the pre-Columbian
discovery of this continent.... To sweep away the cobwebs of error is no
small task, but Professor Hovgaard's book, with its painstaking
following of the scientific method, should go a long way toward its
completion.... Professor Hovgaard has made the best complete exposition
up to date of the voyages of the Norsemen to America. <i>Boston

<p class = "smaller">
He has attempted to trace the development of interest in popular ballads
as reflected in Scandinavian, English, and Scottish criticism
particularly during the eighteenth century.... Mr. Hustvedt's book is
not only valuable by reason of the research and the judicially critical
spirit; it is written in a manner that should interest the general
reader. <i>Boston Herald.</i></p>
